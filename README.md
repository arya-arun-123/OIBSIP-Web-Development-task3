This project provided me with hands-on exposure to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to understand how these technologies work together to build interactive web applications. By designing the user interface and implementing functionality using JavaScript, I was able to strengthen my front-end development skills and improve my problem-solving ability. Working on this project also helped me gain confidence in writing clean code and applying core web development concepts in a practical way.
